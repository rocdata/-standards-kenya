Digitization notes
------------------
- Previous work (2019) using scanning, OCR, and computer vision techniques allows the
  structured data extraction of the "KICD Secondary Curriculum Vol II" book, see
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nqv6CoT0ORtdrfOmhePiGmkNz4cDbu_HFPfpzfwQu4E/edit#gid=358017084 .
- The structure of new CBC curriculum PDF documents is different so requires new approach
